## How it works

This section is subject to change

Each component will have its own components (ex. in the cameras body, the rubber grip and the plastic holding it together) given a rating. The rating will then be a fraction based on how important it is to the part. For example, the plastic in the camera will hold a higher merit than the rubber grips. 

In the end, each components summed up quality will be fraction based again on their importance to form a score from 1-80. Then, a new number will be generated based on how many "essentials" are present or not. For example, if the camera is perfect, has its battery but doesnt have a charger, the score might be high, but not 100/100. If it does have a charger included, then the points might be higher. These points, unlike the core components points, will not be handed out statically, but will instead be given in relation with the points of the core components. If the core components points are low, the extra points will be worth less. This is to prevent giving a generally crappy camera a higher-than-average score just because it came with a camera bag and A/V cable.

If the rating is high, then the camera is a good purchase based on how it has been treated in the past. If the rating is low, then the camera should be avoided if you are looking for something that doesnt need to be completely cleaned and/or repaired. 

A low score does NOT mean that the camera should not be purchased by anyone at all, though. Some might find a camera with a low score useful for parts or to be restored.
